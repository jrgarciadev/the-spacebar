# Stellar Development with Symfony 4

## Setup

If you've just downloaded the code, congratulations!!

To get it working, follow these steps:

**Download Composer dependencies**

Make sure you have [Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
and then run:

```
composer install
```

You may alternatively need to run `php composer.phar install`, depending
on how you installed Composer.

**Start the built-in web server**

You can use Nginx or Apache, but the built-in web server works
great:

```
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public
```

Now check out the site at `http://localhost:8000`

Have fun!
